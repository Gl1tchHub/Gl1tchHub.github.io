A variety of Infobox Updates

- inside of showing a background color for selected tabs, now shows lines on the bottom
- adjusted spacing for infobox gallery tabs to go along with the new infobox spacing

August 1st, 2016
- added styling for side menus (improved side menu titles, and fixed a typo which didn't make the update live earlier)
- added additonal spacing styling for infoboxes. Also added HTML5 audio player styling for compatibility for infoboxes
-- fixced length of audio player as there wasn't a scrollbar (I had CSS that would add it it but it also added scrollbars to other infobox
rows so I didn't add it) and which also explains the infobox spacing changes to make the audio player position more comfortable
- added wikia article text styling, this update includes spacing updates for article text to use less space (got rid of some excess space)
