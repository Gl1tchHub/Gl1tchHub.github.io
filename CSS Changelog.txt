August 1st, 2016
- added styling for side menus (improved side menu titles, and fixed a typo which didn't make the update live earlier)
- added additonal spacing styling for infoboxes. Also added HTML5 audio player styling for compatibility for infoboxes
-- fixced length of audio player as there wasn't a scrollbar (I had CSS that would add it it but it also added scrollbars to other infobox
rows so I didn't add it) and which also explains the infobox spacing changes to make the audio player position more comfortable
- added wikia article text styling, this update includes spacing updates for article text to use less space (got rid of some excess space)

July 31st 201 
- wikia CSS moved to GitHub so one CSS file could be linked to multiple wikias
